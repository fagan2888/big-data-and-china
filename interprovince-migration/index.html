            <h2>About the Dataset</h2>

            <p>
              For the assignment, we were given two small datasets from China Census 2010.
              The first one contained population by province; the second one
              was a 31&times;93 matrix that contained interprovince migration numbers.
              Both datasets contained male, female, and total values.
            </p>

            <p>
              China Census defines interprovince migrants as "people whose place
              of residence doesn't comply with the place of Hukou registration;
              or people who have been away from their place of Hukou registration
              for more than half a year".
            </p>

            <p>
              I decided to focus on total population and removed male and female data.
              To be able to perform visualizations, I geocoded the capitals of all
              provinces. I also assigned each province to either Western, Central, or
              Eastern part of China.
            </p>

            <p>
              The final dataset can be seen in the table below (and downloaded
              <a href="data/dataset.csv">here</a>).
              It contains a distance matrix of migration and its transpose.
              It is redundant, but doing so made it much easier to handle numbers in JavaScript.

            <h2>Total Migration</h2>

            <p>
              The first question that came to my mind was: <b>What are the
              provinces with highest and lowest number of immigrants?</b> To answer this,
              I simply summed up all entires across all rows and columns
              to get the total emigration (residents of the province residing in
              other provinces) and immigration (residents of other provinces
              residing in the province) figures.
            </p>

            <p>
              The scatterplot below shows the total number of immigrants on an x-axis
              and the total number of emigrants on a y-axis. The diagonal line represents
              <i>y = x</i> function. That is, provinces under this line have more
              immigrants than emigrants, which implies their better social and economic
              environment. In the provinces above the line, emigration exceeds
              immigration.

              Of 31 provinces, 14 have immigration exceeding emigration. Among those provinces
              are Guangdong with a record of 21.5 million immigrants and only 880,000 emigrants,
              followed by Zheijang, Shanghai, Jiangsu, and Beijing.
            </p>

            <p>
              Among the most "emigrating" provinces, there are
              Anhui with a record of 9.6 million emigrants and only 717,000 immigrants,
              along with Sichuan, Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi.

            <h2>Net Migration</h2>

            <p>
              I calculated net migration per 1000 inhabitants for each province
              using the formula:
            </p>

            <p class="lead text-center">(I - E) % P &times; 1000</p>

            <p>
              Here, <b>I</b> is the total immigration to the province, <b>E</b> is the total
              emigration from the province, and <b>P</b> is the total population of the province.
            </p>

            <p>
              This is not to be confused with total migration rate, which is
              calculated annually based on the mid-year population and the number
              of immigrants and emigrants that moved in that year.
              The net migration value is the number of immigrants from other provinces per
              1000 people who migrated in the past, not necessarily in that year.
            </p>

            <p>
              Positive value (above 0) implies that
              a province experiences an influx of immigrants. Negative value
              means more people emigrate from a province.
              Net migration values for each province can be seen on the map below.

            <p>
              Of 31 provinces, 14 have positive net migration values, which is
              consistent with the previous scatterplot.
            </p>

            <p>
              Most Eastern provinces experience a greatly positive net migration, with
              Shanghai and Beijing in the leaders. The only four Eastern provinces
              with negative net migration are Heilongjiang and Jilin in the north-east,
              as well as Shandong and Hebei. One of the reasons of negative net migration
              for the latter two might be their proximity to Beijing and Tianjin, the two
              successful Chinese metropolises with more jobs and opportunities.
            </p>

            <p>
              Quite surprisingly, the worst net migration is seen in Central, not Western provinces.
              Anhui and Jiangxi have net migration values below -100. In contrast,
              Tibet, Xinjiang, and Qinghai &ndash; the three westmost provinces of China &ndash;
              along with Inner Mongolia in the North all have positive migration trends.
            </p>

            <p>
              I plotted the same dataset using a sorted bar chart,
              where each bar represents a net migration
              value of a province, and is colored in either blue (<span style="background:#8da0cb">Eastern</span>),
              green (<span style="background:#66c2a5">Western</span>), or orange (<span style="background:#fc8d62">Central</span>). It is easy to spot that
              most Eastern provinces are clustered to the left (highest net migration),
              and all 6 Central provinces are to the right, with negative net
              migration values.

            <h2>Flow Map</h2>

            <p>
              To visualize the entire migration flows, I used a flow map.
              Each province has two circles near their capitals: white (emigration) and grey (immigration).
              By hovering over a circles, one can see all origins or destinations
              of migrants for that province. The thickness of the red lines corresponds to the number
              of migrants: the thicker the line is, the more people move. In the upper
              left corner of the map, one can see the top-5 migrant origins and destinations
              for selected province.
